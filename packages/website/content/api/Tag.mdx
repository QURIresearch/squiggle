Tags are metadata that can be added to Squiggle variables. They are used to add additional information to variables, such as names, descriptions, and visualization options. While tags can be accessed at runtime, they are primarily meant for use with the Squiggle Playground and other visualizations.

Tags can be added to variables either by using their name `Tag.get[Name]` or by using decorators.

## List of Tags

| Tag Name    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Change the default display name for the variable, in the playground.       |
| `doc` | Adds documentation to the variable in the playground.       |
| `showAs` | Change the default view for the value when displayed. |
| `format` | Format a number, date, or duration when displayed. |
| `notebook` | Formats lists as notebooks. |
| `hide` | Don't show the variable in the playground |
| `startOpen` | Start the variable open in the playground |
| `startClosed` | Start the variable closed in the playground |
| `location` | Store the proper location. Helps when you want to locate code corresponding to a variable. |
| `exportData` | Metadata about exported variables. Cannot be added manually. |

## Example

<SquiggleEditor
defaultCode={`@name("My Great Function") // Decorator syntax to add a name tag
@doc("This is an example function.")
@showAs(Calculator) // Show this as a simple calculator in the Playground
exampleFn(f) = f^2

myVarTags = Tag.getAll(exampleFn)

docs = Tag.getDoc(exampleFn)

@hide // Hide this variable in the Playground
helperFn(f) = f `} />
