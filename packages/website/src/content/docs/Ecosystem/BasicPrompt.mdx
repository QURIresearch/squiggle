import BasicPrompt from "../../../mdx/basicPrompt.mdx";

The following is a prompt that we use to help LLMs, like GPT and Claude, write Squiggle code. This would ideally be provided with the full documentation, for example with [this document](/llms/documentationBundle.markdown). 

You can read this document in plaintext [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/refs/heads/main/packages/website/src/mdx/basicPrompt.mdx).

fine for now. */}
{/* Note: you must pass `components` prop to the component; otherwise,
`<CodeBlock>` for Squiggle examples won't be rendered properly. See
