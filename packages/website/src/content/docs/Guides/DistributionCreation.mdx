## Normal

```squiggle
normal(mean: number, stdev: number)
normal({mean: number, stdev: number})
normal({p5: number, p95: number})
normal({p10: number, p90: number})
normal({p25: number, p75: number})
```

Creates a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) with the given mean and standard deviation.

<Tabs items={["normal(5, 1)", "normal(1B, 1B)"]}>
  <Tab value="normal(5, 1)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="normal(5, 1)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="normal(1B, 1B)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="normal(1B, 1B)" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Lognormal

```squiggle
lognormal(mu: number, sigma: number)
lognormal({mean: number, stdev: number})
lognormal({p5: number, p95: number})
lognormal({p10: number, p90: number})
lognormal({p25: number, p75: number})
```

Creates a [lognormal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) with the given mu and sigma.

`Mu` and `sigma` represent the mean and standard deviation of the normal which results when
you take the log of our lognormal distribution. They can be difficult to directly reason about. However, there are several alternative ways to specify a lognormal distribution which are often easier to reason about.

<SquiggleEditor defaultCode="lognormal(0, 0.7)" />


[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="❓ Understanding mu and sigma">
  The log of <code>lognormal(mu, sigma)</code> is a normal distribution with
  mean <code>mu</code>
  and standard deviation <code>sigma</code>. For example, these two distributions
  are identical:  
  <SquiggleEditor
    defaultCode={`normalMean = 10
normalStdDev = 2
logOfLognormal = log(lognormal(normalMean, normalStdDev))
[logOfLognormal, normal(normalMean, normalStdDev)]`}
  />
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## To

```squiggle
(5thPercentile: number) to (95thPercentile: number)
to(5thPercentile: number, 95thPercentile: number)
```

The `to` function is an easy way to generate lognormal distributions using predicted _5th_ and _95th_ percentiles. It's the same as ``lognormal({p5, p95})``, but easier to write and read.

<Tabs items={["5 to 10", "to(5, 10)", "1 to 10000"]}>
  <Tab value="5 to 10">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="5 to 10" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="to(5, 10)">
    <code>5 to 10</code> does the same thing as <code>to(5,10)</code>.
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="to(5,10)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="1 to 10000">
    It's very easy to generate distributions with very long tails. These can be
    impossible to see without changing view settings. (These settings are
    available in the Playground, but not this smaller editor component)
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="1 to 10000" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Arguments

- `5thPercentile`: number
- `95thPercentile`: number, greater than `5thPercentile`

<Callout title="Tip">
  "<strong>To</strong>" is a great way to generate probability distributions very
  quickly from your intuitions. It's easy to write and easy to read. It's
  often a good place to begin an estimate.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Caution">
  If you haven't tried [calibration
  training](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LdFbx9oqtKAAwtKF3/list-of-probability-calibration-exercises),
  you're likely to be overconfident. We recommend doing calibration training
  to get a feel for what a 90 percent confident interval feels like.
</Callout>

## Uniform

```squiggle
uniform(low:number, high:number)
```

Creates a [uniform distribution](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)>) with the given low and high values.

<SquiggleEditor defaultCode="uniform(3,7)" />

### Arguments

- `low`: Number
- `high`: Number greater than `low`

<Callout type="warn" title="Caution">
  While uniform distributions are very simple to understand, we find it rare
  to find uncertainties that actually look like this. Before using a uniform
  distribution, think hard about if you are really 100% confident that the
  paramater will not wind up being just outside the stated boundaries.  
  One good example of a uniform distribution uncertainty would be clear
  physical limitations. You might have complete complete uncertainty on what
  time of day an event will occur, but can say with 100% confidence it will
  happen between the hours of 0:00 and 24:00.
</Callout>

## Point Mass

```squiggle
pointMass(value:number)
```


Creates a discrete distribution with all of its probability mass at point `value`.

Few Squiggle users call the function `pointMass()` directly. Numbers are often (but not always) converted into point mass distributions automatically, when it is appropriate.

For example, in the function `mixture(1,2,normal(5,2))`, the first two arguments will get converted into point mass distributions
with values at 1 and 2. Therefore, this is the same as `mixture(pointMass(1),pointMass(2),pointMass(5,2))`.

`pointMass()` distributions are currently the only discrete distributions accessible in Squiggle.

<Tabs
  items={[
    "pointMass(3)",
    "mixture(1,3,5)",
    "normal(5,2) * 6",
    "dotAdd(normal(5,2), 6)"
  ]}
>
  <Tab value="pointMass(3)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="pointMass(3)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="mixture(1,3,5)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="mixture(1,3,5)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="normal(5,2) * 6">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="normal(5,2) * 6" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="dotAdd(normal(5,2), 6)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="dotAdd(normal(5,2), 6)" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Arguments

- `value`: Number

## Beta

```squiggle
beta(alpha:number, beta:number)
beta({mean: number, stdev: number})
```

Creates a [beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) with the given `alpha` and `beta` values. For a good summary of the beta distribution, see [this explanation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/47782) on Stack Overflow.

<Tabs
  items={[
    "beta(10, 20)",
    "beta(1000, 1000)",
    "beta(1, 10)",
    "beta(10, 1)",
    "beta(0.8, 0.8)",
    "beta({mean: 0.39, stdev: 0.1})",
  ]}
>
  <Tab value="beta(10,20)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="Sym.beta(10,20)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="beta(1000, 2000)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="Sym.beta(1000, 2000)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="beta(1, 10)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="Sym.beta(1, 10)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="beta(10, 1)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="Sym.beta(10, 1)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="beta(0.8, 0.8)">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="Sym.beta(0.8, 0.8)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="beta({mean: 0.39, stdev: 0.1})">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="Sym.beta({mean: 0.39, stdev: 0.1})" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Arguments

- `alpha`: Number greater than zero
- `beta`: Number greater than zero

<Callout type="warn" title="Caution with small numbers">
  Squiggle struggles to show beta distributions when either alpha or beta are
  below 1.0. This is because the tails at ~0.0 and ~1.0 are very high. Using a
  log scale for the y-axis helps here.

    <Accordion title="Examples">
      <Tabs
        items={[
        "beta(0.3, 0.3)",
        "beta(0.5, 0.5)",
        "beta(0.8, 0.8)",
        "beta(0.9, 0.9)",

## Mixture

```squiggle
mixture(...distributions: Distribution[], weights?: number[])
mixture(distributions: Distribution[], weights?: number[])
mx(...distributions: Distribution[], weights?: number[])
mx(distributions: Distribution[], weights?: number[])
```

The `mixture` mixes combines multiple distributions to create a mixture. You can optionally pass in a list of proportional weights.

<Tabs
  items={[
    "Simple",
    "With Weights",
    "With Continuous and Discrete Inputs",
    "Array of Distributions Input",
  ]}
>
  <Tab value="Simple">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="mixture(1 to 2, 5 to 8, 9 to 10)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="With Weights">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="mixture(1 to 2, 5 to 8, 9 to 10, [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="With Continuous and Discrete Inputs">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="mixture(1 to 5, 8 to 10, 1, 3, 20)" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Array of Distributions Input">
    <SquiggleEditor defaultCode="mx([1 to 2, exponential(1)], [1,1])" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Arguments

- `distributions`: A set of distributions or numbers, each passed as a paramater. Numbers will be converted into point mass distributions.
- `weights`: An optional array of numbers, each representing the weight of its corresponding distribution. The weights will be re-scaled to add to `1.0`. If a weights array is provided, it must be the same length as the distribution paramaters.

### Aliases

- `mx`

### Special Use Cases of Mixtures

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="🕐 Zero or Continuous">
    One common reason to have mixtures of continous and discrete distributions is to handle the special case of 0.
    Say I want to model the time I will spend on some upcoming project. I think I have an 80% chance of doing it.  

  In this case, I have a 20% chance of spending 0 time with it. I might estimate my hours with,
  <SquiggleEditor
    defaultCode={`hours_the_project_will_take = 5 to 20
chance_of_doing_anything = 0.8
mx(hours_the_project_will_take, 0, [chance_of_doing_anything, 1 - chance_of_doing_anything])`}
    />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🔒 Model Uncertainty Safeguarding">
    One technique several [Foretold.io](https://www.foretold.io/) users used is to combine their main guess, with a
    "just-in-case distribution". This latter distribution would have very low weight, but would be
    very wide, just in case they were dramatically off for some weird reason.
<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`forecast = 3 to 30
chance_completely_wrong = 0.05
forecast_if_completely_wrong = normal({p5:-100, p95:200})
mx(forecast, forecast_if_completely_wrong, [1-chance_completely_wrong, chance_completely_wrong])`}
/>

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## SampleSet.fromList

```squiggle
SampleSet.fromList(samples:number[])
```

Creates a sample set distribution using an array of samples.  

Samples are converted into PDFs automatically using [kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) and an approximated bandwidth. This is an approximation and can be error-prone.

<SquiggleEditor defaultCode="SampleSet.fromList([1,2,3,4,6,5,5,5])" />

### Arguments

- `samples`: An array of at least 5 numbers.

## PointSet.makeContinuous

```squiggle
PointSet.makeContinuous(points:{x: number, y: number})
```

Creates a continuous point set distribution using a list of points.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`PointSet.makeContinuous([
  { x: 0, y: 0.1 },
  { x: 1, y: 0.2 },
  { x: 2, y: 0.15 },
  { x: 3, y: 0.1 }
])`}
/>

<Callout type="warn" title="Caution!">
  Distributions made with ``makeContinuous`` are not automatically normalized. We suggest normalizing them manually using the ``normalize`` function.
</Callout>

### Arguments

- `points`: An array of at least 3 coordinates.

## PointSet.makeDiscrete

```squiggle
PointSet.makeDiscrete(points:{x: number, y: number})
```

Creates a discrete point set distribution using a list of points.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`PointSet.makeDiscrete([
  { x: 0, y: 0.2 },
  { x: 1, y: 0.3 },
  { x: 2, y: 0.4 },
  { x: 3, y: 0.1 }
])`}
/>

### Arguments

- `points`: An array of at least 1 coordinate.
