import { DemoProjectStateViewer } from '../../../components/DemoProjectStateViewer';
import { Callout, Tabs } from "nextra/components";

## Terminology

- **Project**: a class providing the public APIs for running multi-module Squiggle projects; represented by `SqProject` class
- **Project state**: current state of the project, which includes all modules and their computed outputs; represented by `ProjectState` class
- **Module**: a single Squiggle file with metadata (name and import pins); represented by `SqModule` class
- **Module output**: computed values of a module in a specific environment; represented by `SqModuleOutput` class
- **Linker**: pluggable object that describes how imports are resolved; represented by `SqLinker` type
- **Head**: named entrypoint to the module graph; all modules that are not addressable by some head will be cleaned up from the state eventually
- **Resolution**: hash-based pointer from the module **name** to the specific module object
- **Pin**: hash for an import that guarantees immutability

## Architecture

`SqProject` uses the [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://codemirror.net/docs/guide/#functional-core%2C-imperative-shell) approach inspired by CodeMirror and Git: its state is immutable and updated by dispatching actions.

When something changes in `SqProject` state, it will emit events; you can listen to events and react to them in your own code.

## Minimal example project

```javascript
const project = new SqProject();

project.setHead('main', {
    module: new SqModule({
        name: 'my-module',
        code: 'x = 2 + 2',
    })
});
```

Here's how the project state will look when you run the code above:

<Callout type="info">
  The following examples use a custom wrapper to `<ProjectStateViewer>` that allows you to control the loading and running manually.

  Every time the project attempts to load or run a module, the operation will be blocked, and you'll see a new button in the top row that can resolve the pending promise.

  In a real-world scenario, the loading and running will happen automatically; "Automatic" tab implements that behavior.
</Callout>

<DemoProjectStateViewer
    headName="main"
    headModule="myModule"
    modules={{
        myModule: `x = 2 + 2`
    }}
/>

In the diagram above, **Head** is the entrypoint: it points to the main module that the user is interested in.

Next comes the **module**, `my-module`. If you hover over the module node, you'll see its source code.

The hash string in the module node is its unique identifier. All modules and outputs are content-addressable; for modules, the hash is a SHA-256 sum of its code, name and import pins.

Module leads to its **output**. Output is simulated in a specific environment (`sampleCount`, `xyPointLength` and a `seed`).

Note how the code above only added the head, but the output was computed. The process that happens from setting the head to producing the output can be quite complicated:
- first, the module is parsed
- then its imports are loaded as additional modules
- then the imported modules are parsed and their imports are loaded and so on
- as soon as there's a module that's (1) fully loaded, (2) all of its imports are computed, it will be computed ("simulated")
- this will trigger the simulation of its parents
- eventually, the output for the topmost, head module will be produced

This chain of events is internally represented with **actions**. When you add a head, the first action will be dispatched internally, which might lead to other actions when something is loaded or a simulation was completed.

You can expand the "Action log" in the diagram above to see the actions that were dispatched in this example.

## APIs for reacting to project changes

To be notified about `SqProject` state changes, you can use one of two approaches:

1. `addEventListener`

```javascript
project.addEventListener('state', (event) => {
    console.log(event.data);
});
```

- `state` event will fire on any state changes
- `action` event will fire when `SqProject` dispatches any internal action
- `output` event will fire when `SqProject` produces a new ouptut

Don't forget to clean up a listener; e.g., in a React hook:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const listener: ProjectEventListener<"action"> = (event) => {
        console.log(event.data);
    };
    project.addEventListener("action", listener);
    return () => project.removeEventListener("action", listener);
});
```

2. `waitForOutput` helper

Event listener mechanism is flexible but verbose, so we also provide this shortcut:

```javascript
const output = await project.waitForOutput(headName);
```

## Multi-module example

<br />

<DemoProjectStateViewer
    headName="main"
    headModule="mainModule"
    modules={{
    mainModule: `import "foo" as foo
import "bar" as bar
res = foo.x + bar.x`,
    foo: `export x = 1`,
    bar: `export y = 2`,
    }}
/>

## Linkers

[SqLinker](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/blob/main/packages/squiggle-lang/src/public/SqLinker.ts) type is a pluggable object that describes how imports are resolved.

It allows you to customize the way Squiggle modules are resolved and loaded, by defining two hooks: `linker.resolve` and `linker.loadModule`.

As an example, import statement can look like this: `import "import-name" as importVar`.

In this example, `"import-name"` is a string that will first be resolved by the `linker.resolve` method to the real module name.

Typically, the normalized name is the same as the name in the import, so `linker.resolve` will be defined as `(name) => name`.

In other environments, e.g. in the CLI that relies on the local filesystem, import names can be reslative: `import "./foo" as foo`, and the `linker.resolve` function will normalize that to the absolute path.

After the name is resolved, the module is loaded with `linker.loadModule` method.

For example, on [Squiggle Hub](https://squigglehub.org), we use a custom linker that fetches `hub:*` modules from the server through GraphQL.

In the command-line `squiggle` script, we load modules from the local filesystem.

For now, [Squiggle Playground](/playground) doesn't have a linker, but in the future we plan to add a way to load modules from Squiggle Hub or other sources.

## Garbage collection

When you add a head to the project, it will start computing the outputs for all modules that are reachable from the head.

When you update a head, the project will clean up all modules that are not reachable from the remaining set of heads.

## Dependency resolving and pinning

<Callout type="warning">
    This functionality is still untested. We don't use dependency pinning on Squiggle Hub yet.
</Callout>

`linker.loadModule` method takes two parameters: the module name and its optional hash that comes from pins stored on the parent module object.

If the hash is provided, the linker **must** return the module with that hash.

If **all** modules have pins, all the way down to the leaf modules, the project will be completely deterministic and reproducible. This is going to be useful for caching in the future releases of Squiggle.

## Performance considerations

There are a few places in `SqProject` implementation where we make the full scan of the state to decide which parts we need to run next.

This shouldn't matter for small projects, but for large projects with hundreds of modules, it might become a bottleneck. This is something we plan to address in the future.
