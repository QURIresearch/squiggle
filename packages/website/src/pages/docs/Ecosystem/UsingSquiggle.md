description: Where to use Squiggle
---

You can currently interact with Squiggle in a few ways:

**[Squiggle Hub](https://squigglehub.org/)**  
Squiggle Hub is a platform for the creation and sharing of code written in Squiggle. It's a great way to get started with Squiggle or to share your models with others.

**[Playground](/playground)**  
The [Squiggle Playground](/playground) is a nice tool for working with small models and making prototypes. You can make simple shareable links, but you can't save models that change over time.

**[Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=QURI.vscode-squiggle)**  
There's a simple [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=QURI.vscode-squiggle) for running and visualizing Squiggle code. We find that VS Code is a useful editor for managing larger Squiggle setups.

**[Typescript Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-lang)**  
Squiggle is built using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and is accessible via a simple Typescript library. You can use this library to either run Squiggle code in full, or to call select specific functions within Squiggle.

**[React Components Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-components)**  
All of the components used in the playground and documentation are available in a separate component NPM repo. You can see the full Storybook of components [here](https://components.squiggle-language.com).

**[Observable](https://observablehq.com/@hazelfire/squiggle)**  
You can use Squiggle Components in Observable notebooks. Sam Nolan put together an exportable [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@hazelfire/squiggle) of the key components that you can directly import and use in your Observable notebooks.
