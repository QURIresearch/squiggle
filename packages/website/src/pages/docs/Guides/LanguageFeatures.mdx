# Language Features

## Program Structure

A Squiggle program consists of a series of definitions (for example, `x = 5`, `f(x) = x * x`). This can optionally conclude with an *end expression*.

If an end expression is provided, it becomes the evaluated output of the program, and only this result will be displayed in the viewer. Otherwise, all top-level variable definitions will be displayed.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
y = 10
x + y`}
/>

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
y = 10`}
/>

## Immutability

All variables in Squiggle are immutable, similar to other functional programming languages like OCaml or Haskell.

In the case of container types (lists and dictionaries), this implies that an operation such as myList[3] = 10 is not permitted. Instead, we recommend using `List.map`, `List.reduce` or other [List functions](/docs/Api/List).

In case of basic types such as numbers or strings, the impact of immutability is more subtle.

Consider this code:

```squiggle
x = 5
x = x + 5
```

While it appears that the value of x has changed, what actually occurred is the creation of a new variable with the same name, which [shadowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing) the previous x variable.

In most cases, shadowing behaves identically to what you'd expect in languages like JavaScript or Python.

One case where shadowing matters is closures:

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
argPlusX(y) = x + y

x = x + 5

argPlusX(5)`}
/>

In the above example, the `argPlusX` function captures the value of `x` from line 1, not the newly shadowed `x` from line 4. As a result, `argPlusX(5)` returns 10, not 15.

## Unit Type Annotations

Variable declarations may optionally be annotated with *unit types*, such as `kilograms` or `dollars`. Unit types are declared with `::`, for example:

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`distance :: meters = 100`}
/>

A unit type can be any identifier, and you don't have to define a unit type before you use it.

You can also create composite unit types using `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and '^' (exponentiation). For example:

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`raceDistance :: m = 100
usainBoltTime :: s = 9.58
usainBoltSpeed :: m/s = raceDistance / usainBoltTime`}
/>

You can use any number of `*` and `/` operators in a unit type, but you cannot use parentheses. Unit type operators follow standard order of operations: `*` and `/` are left-associative and have the same precedence, and `^` has higher precedence.

The following unit types are all equivalent: `kg*m/s^2`, `kg*m/s/s`, `m/s*kg/s`, `m/s^2*kg`, `kg*m^2/m/s/s`.

For unitless types, you may use a number in the unit type annotation (by convention you should use the number `1`):

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`springConstant :: 1 = 10
inverseTime :: 1/s = 20`}
/>

If you use unit type annotations, Squiggle will enforce that variables must have consistent unit types.

If a variable does not have a unit type annotation, Squiggle will attempt to infer its unit type. If the unit type can't be inferred, the variable is treated as any type.

Inline unit type annotations are not currently supported (for example, `x = (y :: meters)`).

Operators and functions obey the following semantics:

- Multiplying or dividing two unit-typed variables multiplies or divides their unit types (respectively).
- Raising a unit-typed variable to a power produces a result of any unit type (i.e., the result is not type-checked).
- Most binary operators, including `+`, `-`, and comparison operators (`==`, `>=`, etc.), require that both arguments have the same unit type.
- Built-in functions can take any unit type and return any unit type.

## Blocks

Blocks are special expressions in Squiggle that can contain any number of local definitions and end with an expression.

<SquiggleEditor
defaultCode={`x = { 5 } // same as "x = 5"
y = {
  t = 10 // local variable, won't be available outside of the block body
  5 * t // end expression
}
`} />

## Conditionals

If/then/else statements in Squiggle are values too.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
if x<8 then 10 else 3`}
/>

See [Control flow](/docs/Guides/ControlFlow) for more details and examples.

## Comments

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`// This is a single-line comment\n
/*
This is a multiple
-line comment.
*/
foo = 5
`}
/>

## Pipes

Squiggle features [data-first](https://www.javierchavarri.com/data-first-and-data-last-a-comparison/) pipes. Functions in the standard library are organized to make this convenient.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`normal(5,2) -> truncateLeft(3) -> SampleSet.fromDist -> SampleSet.map({|r| r + 10})`}
/>

## Standard Library

Squiggle features a simple [standard libary](/docs/Api/Dist).

Most functions are namespaced under their respective types to keep functionality distinct. Certain popular functions are usable without their namespaces.

For example,

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`a = List.upTo(0, 5000) -> SampleSet.fromList // namespaces required
b = normal(5,2) // namespace not required
c = 5 to 10 // namespace not required`}
/>

## Simple Error Handling

Squiggle supports the functions [throw](/docs/Api/Common#throw) and [try](/docs/Api/Common#try) for simple error handling. It does not yet have proper error types.
