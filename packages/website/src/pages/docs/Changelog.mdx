# Changelog

## 0.8.0

### [@quri/squiggle-lang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-lang)
#### Breaking changes
* `SampleSet` distributions are now used as the default.
  * This change is important because only SampleSet distributions handle correlations, and users expecting correlations got confused when the defaults were for symbolic distributions instead. If you want to use symbolic formats, you can, like: ``Sym.normal(5,2)``.  
* `a to b` expressions always evaluate to lognormal distributions, limited to positive-only arguments. 
  * Previously these changed to use normal distributions at values zero or less, and this confused users. https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/issues/1095.
* `|>` pipes syntax is removed, in favor of the `->` syntax.
  * We had two syntaxes that did the same thing, and wanted to clean this up.
* `#` comments support is removed, in favor of the `//` syntax.
* Renamed functions such as `scaleLog`, `scalePow`, etc. to `Danger.mapYLog`, `Danger.mapYPow`, etc.
  * These were infrequently used and prone to errors. 
* Default sampleCount in squiggle-lang is now 1k, matching playground.

#### New features
* Parameter annotations: `f(x: [0, 10]) = ...`; see [docs](https://preview.squiggle-language.com/docs/Guides/Language#parameter-annotations) for details
* `Plot.distFn` and `Plot.numericFn` (`Plot.fn` is removed)
* Support for manual plot [scales](https://squiggle-language.com/docs/Api/Plot#scales) 
* Support for docstrings. `/** ... */` comments are displayed in the viewer
* `List.reduceWhile` function
* Dicts and bindings are ordered
* `map` callback supports an optional second ``index`` parameter
* Support for `{ foo, bar }` shorthand in dicts
* Mixture correlations https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/1732

#### Fixes
* Exponentiation is right-associative
* Units are whitelisted; `100blah` is a syntax error
* Fixed error message when ternary condition is wrong

#### Performance improvements
* ~2x speedup on synthetic lambda-heavy benchmarks; similar improvements on real code, on average

### [@quri/squiggle-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-components)
#### Breaking changes
* Many `@quri/squiggle-lang` APIs have changed, so this package should be updated at the same time as `@quri/squiggle-components`
* "Input variables" tab was removed; you can inject your JSON data directly into Squiggle instead

#### New features
* Movable divider between editor and graph view
* Support for new plots: `Plot.scatter`, `Table.make` and others
* New default tick format. This fixes an error that small numbers (`0.01`) were shown as `10m`; #2007.
* Ability to "zoom in" on any variable in viewer; #1913
* "Find in editor" button in viewer
* Other various updates to the playground UI

#### Fixes
* Display Infinity as "Infinity"
* Fix shortcut tooltips on non-macs
* Charts filter out infinity values from the domain
* Improve tooltip for errors in editor

### [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=QURI.vscode-squiggle)
* Improvements to syntax highlighter

### [@quri/prettier-plugin-squiggle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/prettier-plugin-squiggle)
**Initial release.** Install this package to format any Squiggle code with [https://prettier.io](Prettier). Requires Prettier v3.

### @quri/ui
Initial release with common UI components by QURI, used in squiggle-components and Squiggle Hub. [Storybook](https://quri-ui.vercel.app/)

You probably shouldn't use this package directly if you don't work at QURI, because we don't have any stability guarantees and optimize for our convenience.

### Other
* [Squiggle Hub](https://squigglehub.org/) was released
* New [documentation](https://www.squiggle-language.com/), now with search
* We've started work on relative values functionality in Squiggle Hub. This is still fairly error-prone, we'll work on cleaning it up in the next few months.

## 0.7.0

### @quri/squiggle-lang

Language:

- New functions: `List.concat`, `List.uniq`, `List.append`, `List.flatten`, `List.join`, `Dict.mapKeys`.
- `stdev` and `variance` work for all kinds of distributions.
- Support for `==`, `!=` and `+` on strings.
- Support for trailing comma in arrays: `arr = [5,6,]` is now allowed.
- `Plot.fn` allows for programmatical control of `min..max` range in charts.
- Support for `{ p10: ..., p90: ... }` and `{ p25: ..., p75: ... }` in `normal()` and `lognormal()`.
- Non-integer key lookups in arrays are now disallowed; `arr[1.5]` and `arr[3/0]` will result in error; previously non-integer keys got rounded to 0 or the closest integer.
- Fix for zero parameter function quirks; the checks are now stricter and some existing code might break.
- Fix for `normal(5,2) * 0` special case.
- Fix for summary stats and `inv` function on `pointMass` distributions.
- Fix for `inv` and `sample` on discrete distributions.

JS API:

- `sq` function allows to embed Squiggle code in JS with syntax highlighting in VS Code (when VS Code extension is installed).
- `value.asJS()` method for easier conversion of results to JS values.

Other:

- ES6 modules build (we still provide CommonJS build as well).

### @quri/squiggle-components

UI:

- New code editor based on Codemirror, with the improved syntax highlighting and auto-completion for variables and stdlib functions.
- Charts are now implemented in pure Canvas with D3 (instead of Vega), with some improvements in UI and rendering speed.

Other:

- This package is now ESM-only! We depend on D3, and D3 is ESM-only, so squiggle-components has to be ESM-only as well. If your project still uses CommonJS and you doesn't use Next.js or other smart transpiler, you might encounter problems. See [this document](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) for advice.
- Much smaller bundle size, thanks to removing some heavy dependencies.
- `oneLine` prop in `SquiggleEditor` removed (probably no one used it).

## 0.6.0

- Language reimplemented in Typescript instead of Rescript.
- 2x performance boost on average on typical Squiggle code. Most improvements come from optimizations in distribution operations.
- Color fixes and improved distribution charts in components.
- `mean()` on mixed pointsets now works correctly.

## 0.5.1

- Error locations and stacktraces.
- New functions: `List.length`, `Dist.set` and `Dist.map`.
- Improved `to` precedence order.
- Improvements to `->` operator: more stuff can be passed on the right side, e.g. anonymous functions.
- Support for empty dicts (`{}`).
- Various performance improvements; overall speedup on real code is around 5%.

## 0.5.0

- Performance improvements:
  - Interpreter is now 5x-20x faster on code written in Squiggle
  - SampleSet to PointSet conversions are 2x faster
  - cdf function on SampleSets is 30x faster
  - overall speedup is about 2x on average on real code written in Squiggle
- 50% smaller bundle size for [@quri/squiggle-lang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-lang); 20% smaller bundle size for [@quri/squiggle-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-components).

### Breaking changes

Some rarely used math functions got removed or moved to the `Math` namespace.

For example, `cos(x)` is now `Math.cos(x)`, and `atanh(x)` doesn't exist.

If your code is now failing with `<function> is not defined` for anything from [this list](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html), try adding `Math.` prefix first, and then complain on [Github issues](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/issues).
