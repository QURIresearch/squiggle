# Tag

Tags are metadata that can be added to Squiggle variables. They are used to add additional information to variables, such as names, descriptions, and visualization options. While tags can be accessed at runtime, they are primarily meant for use with the Squiggle Playground and other visualizations.

Tags can be added to variables either by using their name `Tag.[name]` or by using decorators.

## Examples
<SquiggleEditor
defaultCode={`@name("My Great Function") // Decorator syntax to add a name tag
@description("This is an example function.")
@showAs(Calculator) // Show this as a simple calculator in the Playground
exampleFn(f) = f^2
  
myVarTags = Tag.all(exampleFn)
  
description = Tag.getDescription(exampleFn)
  
@hide // Hide this variable in the Playground
helperFn(f) = f `}/>


## List of Tags
| Tag Name    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Change the default display name for the variable, in the Playground.       |
| `description` | Adds a description to the variable in the playground.       |
| `showAs` | Change the default view for the value when displayed. |
| `format` | Format a number, date, or duration when displayed. |
| `hide` | Don't show the variable in the Playground |

## Definitions

### name
      ```
  ('A, String) => 'A
  ```
      Adds a user-facing name to a value. This is useful for documenting what a value represents, or how it was calculated. Names are shown in the visualizations sidebar.

*Note: While names are shown in the sidebar, you still need to call variables by their regular variable names in code.*
      

### getName
      ```
  (any) => String
  ```
      
      

### description
      ```
  ('A, String) => 'A
  ```
      Adds a description to a value. This is useful for documenting what a value represents, or how it was calculated. Descriptions are shown in the visualizations sidebar.
    
*Note: Descriptions provided as tags look like docstrings, but are not docstrings. Docstrings don't get imported with the variable into other files, but descriptions do.*
      

### getDescription
      ```
  (any) => String
  ```
      
      

### showAs
      ```
  (Dist, Plot|(Dist) => Plot) => Dist
(List(any), Table|(List(any)) => Table) => List(any)
((Number) => Dist|Number, Plot|Calculator|((Number) => Dist|Number) => Plot|Calculator) => (Number) => Dist|Number
((Date) => Dist|Number, Plot|Calculator|((Date) => Dist|Number) => Plot|Calculator) => (Date) => Dist|Number
((Duration) => Dist|Number, Plot|Calculator|((Duration) => Dist|Number) => Plot|Calculator) => (Duration) => Dist|Number
(Function, Calculator|(Function) => Calculator) => Function
  ```
      
Overrides the default visualization for a value.

`showAs()` can take either a visualization, or a function that calls the value and returns a visualization. You can use it like,  
```js
example1 = {|x| x + 1} -> Tag.showAs(Calculator)

@showAs({|f| Plot.numericFn(f, { xScale: Scale.symlog() })})
example2 = {|x| x + 1}
```

Different types of values can be displayed in different ways. The following table shows the potential visualization types for each input type. In this table, `Number` can be used with Dates and Durations as well.

| Input Type    | Visualization Types |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Distribution    | `Plot.dist`       |
| List    | `Table`       |
| `(Number -> Number)` Function | `Plot.numericFn`, `Calculator`        |
| `(Number -> Dist)` Function | `Plot.distFn`, `Calculator`        |
| Function | `Calculator`        |


      

### getShowAs
      ```
  (any) => any
  ```
      
      

### format
      ```
  (Dist|Number, numberFormat: String) => Dist|Number
(Duration, numberFormat: String) => Duration
(Date, timeFormat: String) => Date
  ```
      Set the display format for a number, distribution, duration, or date. Uses the [d3-format](https://d3js.org/d3-format) syntax on numbers and distributions, and the [d3-time-format](https://d3js.org/d3-time-format) syntax for dates.
      

### getFormat
      ```
  (Dist|Number) => String
(Duration) => String
(Date) => String
  ```
      
      

### all
      ```
  (any) => Dict(any)
  ```
      Returns all tags as a Dictionary.
      

### hide
      ```
  ('A, Bool) => 'A
('A) => 'A
  ```
      Hides a value in the visualizations sidebar. This is useful for hiding intermediate values that are used in calculations, but are not directly relevant to the user. Only hides top-level variables.
      

### getHide
      ```
  (any) => Bool
  ```
      
      

### omit
      ```
  ('A, List(String)) => 'A
  ```
      Returns a copy of the value with the specified tags removed.
      

### clear
      ```
  ('A) => 'A
  ```
      Returns a copy of the value with all tags removed.
