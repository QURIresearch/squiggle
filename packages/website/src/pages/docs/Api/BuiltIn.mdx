### typeOf 

Returns the type of the value passed in as a string. This is useful when you want to treat a value differently depending on its type.

```
typeOf: (any) => string
```

```squiggle
fn(v) = if typeOf(v) == "String" then v else if typeOf(v) ==
  "Number" then "the number: " + v else "other"
```

### inspect 

Runs Console.log() in the [Javascript developer console](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-developer-console) and returns the value passed in.

```
inspect: (`a) => `a
inspect: (`a, string) => `a
```

```squiggle
foo = inspect(5 to 10) // sets foo to (5 to 10) and logs it to the console
foo = inspect(5 to 10, "my range")
```
