## Creating dependent distributions

You may at some points want to define two distributions that are not indipendent
from each other. To do this, you must use sample sets.

The samples in Sample Set distributions in Squiggle are ordered. The first sample in one Sample Set distribution will correspond to the first sample in a distribution that comes from a resulting Monte Carlo generation. Therefore, Sample Set distributions in a chain of Monte Carlo generations are likely to all be correlated with each other. This connection breaks if any node changes to the Point Set or Symbolic format.

In this example, we subtract all three types of distributions by themselves. Notice that the Sample Set distribution returns 1. The other two return the result of subtracting one normal distribution from a separate uncorrelated distribution. These results are clearly very different to each other.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`sampleSetDist = normal(5,2) |> SampleSet.fromDist
sampleSetDistToPointSet = sampleSetDist |> PointSet.fromDist
symbolicDist = normal(5,2)
[sampleSetDist-sampleSetDist, sampleSetDistToPointSet-sampleSetDistToPointSet, symbolicDist-symbolicDist]`}
