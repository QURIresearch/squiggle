The Plot module provides functions to create plots of distributions and functions. The two primary functions are `Plot.dists` and `Plot.fn`, which allow you to plot multiple labeled distributions and plot functions respectively.

### Plot.dists

Plots one or more labeled distributions on the same plot. Distributions can be either continuous, discrete, or a single number.

```
Plot.dists: ({dists: list<{name: string, value: distribution | number}>}) => plot
```

Examples:

```
Plot.dists({
    dists: [{name: "dist", value: normal(0, 1)}]
});
```

```
plot = Plot.dists({
    dists: [
        { name: "Normal(0,1)", value: normal(0, 1) },
        { name: "Normal(2,1)", value: normal(2, 1) },
    ]
})
```

### Plot.fn

Plots a function within a specified range of x-values.

```
Plot.fn: ({fn: (number => number), min: number, max: number}) => plot
```

Examples:

```
Plot.fn({fn: {|x| x * x}, min: 3, max: 5})
```

```
const plot = Plot.fn({
    fn: {|x| Math.sin(x)},
    min: 0,
    max: 2 * Math.pi,
})
```
