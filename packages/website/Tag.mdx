### name
      ```
  ('A, String) => 'A
  ```
      Adds a user-facing name to a value. This is useful for documenting what a value represents, or how it was calculated. Names are shown in the visualizations sidebar.

*Note: While names are shown in the sidebar, you still need to call variables by their regular variable names in code.*
      

### getName
      ```
  (any) => String
  ```
      undefined
      

### description
      ```
  ('A, String) => 'A
  ```
      Adds a description to a value. This is useful for documenting what a value represents, or how it was calculated. Descriptions are shown in the visualizations sidebar.
    
*Note: Descriptions provided as tags look like docstrings, but are not docstrings. Docstrings don't get imported with the variable into other files, but descriptions do.*
      

### getDescription
      ```
  (any) => String
  ```
      undefined
      

### showAs
      ```
  (Dist, Plot|(Dist) => Plot) => Dist
(List(any), Table|(List(any)) => Table) => List(any)
((Number) => Dist|Number, Plot|Calculator|((Number) => Dist|Number) => Plot|Calculator) => (Number) => Dist|Number
((Date) => Dist|Number, Plot|Calculator|((Date) => Dist|Number) => Plot|Calculator) => (Date) => Dist|Number
((Duration) => Dist|Number, Plot|Calculator|((Duration) => Dist|Number) => Plot|Calculator) => (Duration) => Dist|Number
(Function, Calculator|(Function) => Calculator) => Function
  ```
      
Overrides the default visualization for a value.

`showAs()` can take either a visualization, or a function that calls the value and returns a visualization. You can use it like,  
```js
example1 = {|x| x + 1} -> Tag.showAs(Calculator)

@showAs({|f| Plot.numericFn(f, { xScale: Scale.symlog() })})
example2 = {|x| x + 1}
```

Different types of values can be displayed in different ways. The following table shows the potential visualization types for each input type. In this table, `Number` can be used with Dates and Durations as well.

| Input Type    | Visualization Types |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Distribution    | `Plot.dist`       |
| List    | `Table`       |
| `(Number -> Number)` Function | `Plot.numericFn`, `Calculator`        |
| `(Number -> Dist)` Function | `Plot.distFn`, `Calculator`        |
| Function | `Calculator`        |


      

### getShowAs
      ```
  (any) => any
  ```
      undefined
      

### format
      ```
  (Dist|Number, numberFormat: String) => Dist|Number
(Duration, numberFormat: String) => Duration
(Date, timeFormat: String) => Date
  ```
      Set the display format for a number, distribution, duration, or date. Uses the [d3-format](https://d3js.org/d3-format) syntax on numbers and distributions, and the [d3-time-format](https://d3js.org/d3-time-format) syntax for dates.
      

### getFormat
      ```
  (Dist|Number) => String
(Duration) => String
(Date) => String
  ```
      undefined
      

### all
      ```
  (any) => Dict(any)
  ```
      Returns all tags as a Dictionary.
      

### hide
      ```
  ('A, Bool) => 'A
('A) => 'A
  ```
      Hides a value in the visualizations sidebar. This is useful for hiding intermediate values that are used in calculations, but are not directly relevant to the user. Only hides top-level variables.
      

### getHide
      ```
  (any) => Bool
  ```
      undefined
      

### omit
      ```
  ('A, List(String)) => 'A
  ```
      Returns a copy of the value with the specified tags removed.
      

### clear
      ```
  ('A) => 'A
  ```
      Returns a copy of the value with all tags removed.
