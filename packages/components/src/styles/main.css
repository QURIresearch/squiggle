Fork of https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms styles (with strategy: "class"), but with `.squiggle` scoping.
This is necessary because tailwindcss-forms's css specificity is lower than preflight's specificity (`padding: 0` and so on),
so unscoped forms css with scoped preflight css, and there's no setting for scoping.

Used for resizable panes in the playground.
