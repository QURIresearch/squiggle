# Squiggle Chart

Squiggle chart evaluates squiggle expressions, and then returns a graph representing
the result of a squiggle expression.

A squiggle expression can have three different types of returns. A distribution,
a constant, and a function.

A distribution means that the result forms a probability distribution. This
could be continuous, discrete or mixed.
