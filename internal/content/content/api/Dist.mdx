description: Distributions are the flagship data type in Squiggle. The distribution type is a generic data type that contains one of three different formats of distributions.
sections:
- name: Distributions
  description: |
    These are functions for creating primitive distributions. Many of these could optionally take in distributions as inputs. In these cases, Monte Carlo Sampling will be used to generate the greater distribution. This can be used for simple hierarchical models

    See a longer tutorial on creating distributions [here](/docs/Guides/DistributionCreation).

    Pointwise arithmetic operations cover the standard arithmetic operations, but work in a different way than the regular operations. These operate on the y-values of the distributions instead of the x-values. A pointwise addition would add the y-values of two distributions.

    The infixes `.+`, `.-`, `.*`, `./`, `.^` are supported for their respective operations. `Mixture` works using pointwise addition. 
  
    Pointwise operations work on Point Set distributions, so will convert other distributions to Point Set ones first. Pointwise arithmetic operations typically return unnormalized or completely invalid distributions. For example, the operation{" "} <code>normal(5,2) .- uniform(10,12)</code> results in a distribution-like object with negative probability mass.
- name: Normalization
  description: |
    There are some situations where computation will return unnormalized distributions. This means that their cumulative sums are not equal to 1.0. Unnormalized distributions are not valid for many relevant functions; for example, klDivergence and scoring.
  
    The only functions that do not return normalized distributions are the pointwise arithmetic operations and the scalewise arithmetic operations. If you use these functions, it is recommended that you consider normalizing the resulting distributions.

- name: Scoring

These subtypes are [point set](/docs/api/DistPointSet), [sample set](/docs/api/DistSampleSet), and [symbolic](/docs/api/Sym). The first two of these have a few custom functions that only work on them. You can read more about the differences between these formats [here](/docs/Discussions/Three-Formats-Of-Distributions).

Several functions below only can work on particular distribution formats. For example, scoring and pointwise math requires the point set format. When this happens, the types are automatically converted to the correct format. These conversions are lossy.

Distributions are created as [sample sets](/DistSampleSet) by default. To create a symbolic distribution, use `Sym.` namespace: `Sym.normal`, `Sym.beta` and so on.
