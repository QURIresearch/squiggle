It's useful to distinguish point set distributions from arbitrary lists of numbers to make it clear which functions are applicable.

Monte Carlo calculations typically result in sample set distributions.

All regular distribution function work on sample set distributions. In addition, there are several functions that only work on sample set distributions.
