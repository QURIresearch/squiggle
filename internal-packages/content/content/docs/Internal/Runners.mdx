title: Runners and Serialization
description: Runners provide a pluggable way to evaluate Squiggle code in different environments.
---

Users of squiggle-lang JS APIs usually run Squiggle with `SqProject`, which can take a runner:

```typescript
const project = new SqProject({
  runner: new WebWorkerRunner(),
});
```

Runner is an object that implements the runner interface, and converts `RunParams` (Squiggle module, environment, and evaluated imports) to a `RunResult` (the result of the evaluation).

`@quri/squiggle-lang` exports a number of built-in runners, which are described below.

## Built-in Runners

### EmbeddedRunner

This is a legacy runner that runs Squiggle code in the main thread.

Its main downside is that Squiggle execution is synchronous, so it blocks the main thread. This is a problem for web applications, where we want to be able to run Squiggle code without blocking the UI.

### WebWorkerRunner

This runner runs Squiggle code in a Web Worker.

This runner is only available in the browser.

#### Next.js warnings

When used with [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) in the latest Next.js, you might see these errors in the console:

```
 âš  ./packages/squiggle-lang/dist/runners/WebWorkerRunner.js:8:23
error TP1001 new Worker(./esbuild-worker.js relative, {"type": "module"}) is not statically analyse-able
   6 |         }
   7 |         super();
>  8 |         this.worker = new Worker(new URL("./esbuild-worker.js", import.meta.url), {
     |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>  9 |             type: "module",
     | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
> 10 |         });
     | ^^^^^^^^^^^
  11 |     }
  12 |     async getWorker() {
  13 |         return this.worker;
```

As far as we can tell, these errors are benign and do not affect the functionality of the runner.

#### Performance notes

Starting with Squiggle 0.10.0, this runner (wrapped with `PoolRunner`) is used by default in Squiggle React components.

It fixes most of UI freezes that were caused by long-running Squiggle evaluations.

Freezes can still occur in some cases:
- When component rendering is slow, e.g. you try to render hundreds of distribution charts simultaneously
- when the _output_ of the model is large, and serialization/deserialization of outputs itself becomes costly; for example, [List.upTo(1,300000) -> sum](https://www.squiggle-language.com/playground?v=0.10.0#code=eNqrVkpJTUsszSlxzk9JVbJS8sksLtErLQjJ1zDUMTYAAU0FXTuF4tJcpVoAQ6cNXg%3D%3D) is fast, while [List.upTo(1, 50000)](https://www.squiggle-language.com/playground?v=0.10.0#code=eNqrVkpJTUsszSlxzk9JVbJS8sksLtErLQjJ1zDUMTUAAk2lWgDi9Qsw) is slow.

### NodeWorkerRunner

This runner runs Squiggle code in a Node.js worker.

This runner is only available in Node.js environment.

### PoolRunner

This runner runs Squiggle code in a pool of other runners.

It is parameterized by two arguments:

- `makeRunner`: a function that creates a new runner.
- `maxWorkers`: the maximum number of workers to run in parallel.

If all runners are busy, the pool will block the caller until a runner is available.

```ts
const project = new SqProject({
  runner: new PoolRunner({
            makeRunner: () => new WebWorkerRunner(),
            maxWorkers: 10,
  }),
});
```

## Serialization

### Reversible Serialization

Most runners, with the exception of `EmbeddedRunner`, marshall their outputs back to the main thread in serialized form.

Serializing and deserializing Squiggle outputs is somewhat complicated, because:

- values can reference other values, so we need to serialize the entire value graph (in general, Squiggle values are not trees, DAGs, directed acyclic graphs)
- values can include lambdas, for which we have to serialize their ASTs and captured variables

To do this, we rely on the [@quri/serialization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/serializer) package, which does most of the heavy lifting.

**Important:** serialized values are not compatible across Squiggle versions.

### Simple Value Serialization

Full reversible serialization is reliable, but its serialized form is not human-readable.

To address this, we provide a simple serialization format that is human-readable, but not reversible.

This serialization format is available:

- via `Danger.json` and `Danger.jsonString` functions in Squiggle language.
- via `simpleValueFromAny` function in `@quri/squiggle-lang` package JS API.

This serialization format is unstable and generally should not be relied upon for long-term storage.

But it can be useful for debugging or for interacting with LLMs (when you want to show a human-readable summary of a Squiggle value).
