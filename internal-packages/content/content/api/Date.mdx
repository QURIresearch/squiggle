Dates are stored as milliseconds since the epoch. They are immutable, and all functions that modify dates return a new date. Used with [Duration](./Duration) values.

Dates can be useful for modeling values that change over time. Below is a simple example of a function that returns a normal distribution that changes over time, based on the number of years passed since 2020.
<SquiggleEditor
defaultCode={`f(t: [Date(2020), Date(2040)]) = {
yearsPassed = toYears(t - Date(2020))
normal({mean: yearsPassed ^ 2, stdev: yearsPassed^1.3+1})
}`}/>
