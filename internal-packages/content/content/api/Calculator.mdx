description: The Calculator module helps you create custom calculators
---

The Calculator module allows you to make custom calculators for functions. This is a form that's tied to a specific Squiggle function, where the inputs to the form are passed to that function, and the output of the function gets shown on the bottom.

Calculators can be useful for debugging functions or to present functions to end users.
