    The JSON module provides JSON-like objects in Squiggle. `Danger.json` is mainly useful for debugging, and `Danger.jsonString` is useful for sending data to other systems. A simple example is shown below.

    We have custom serializers for different Squiggle objects. Note that this API is unstable and might change over time.

    <SquiggleEditor
    defaultCode={`sampleSet = 30 to 50
    pointSet = Sym.normal(5, 2)
    plot = Plot.dists([sampleSet, pointSet])
    fn(e) = e

    @notebook
    result = [
    "### Danger.json()",
    Danger.json([sampleSet, pointSet, plot, fn]),
    "### Danger.jsonString",
    // We don't show sampleSet or plot below because they would be too large, but feel free to try that out
    Danger.jsonString([pointSet, fn]),
    ]
    result
    `}/>

The Danger library contains newer experimental functions which are less stable than Squiggle as a whole. They are not recommended for production use, but are useful for testing out new ideas.
